# Safrole Test Vectors

We offer two types of test vectors:

- Tiny: These are designed for quick adjustments and prototyping, with reduced validators (6)
  and a shorter epoch duration (12). They are provided in both JSON format for easy inspection
  and modification, and in SCALE format, which is the production binary codec.

- Full: These vectors use production validators count (1023) and epoch duration (600).
  Similar to the tiny vectors, they are available in JSON and SCALE format.

Both JSON and SCALE formats conform to the specified ASN.1 schema provided [here](./safrole.asn).

## zk-SNARK SRS

Ring proofs were constructed using a SNARK built using the the [Zcash SRS paramaters](zcash-srs-2-11-uncompressed.bin).
([powers of tau ceremony details](https://zfnd.org/conclusion-of-the-powers-of-tau-ceremony)).

For construction and usage refer to Bandersnatch vrfs spec [example](https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/tree/main/example).

NOTE: for "tiny" initialize the `RingContext` with `ring_size = 6`; while for full `ring size = 1023`.

## Safrole **is not** Sassafras

You can use the Sassafras [RFC](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0026-sassafras-consensus.md)
as a guideline provided it does not conflict with the protocol described by the *Graypaper*
If case of any discrepancy, the *Graypaper* **must** be considered the authoritative source
for the JAM protocol.

Here are some key differences:
- Safrole does not use a threshold to determine if a ticket score should be considered.
  A ticket is persisted in the state if the ticket accumulator is not full or if the
  score is lower than the highest score currently in the accumulator (which is removed
  after the new ticket is inserted).
- Safrole requires the entire ticket accumulator to be filled before it can be used.
  If not enough tickets are received, a fallback mechanism is enacted. In contrast,
  Sassafras can operate with an epoch that is only partially filled with tickets.
- In Safrole, the ticket envelope contains no additional application-specific data,
  it includes only the "attempt" and the "ring proof".

Most of these differences aim to provide a clear and concise protocol specification.

## Error Output

On STF (State Transition Function) execution error, post-state must match pre-state.

Possible error codes returned as output are not part of the specification,
feel free to ignore actual numeric values.

A map for errors codes semantics used by for the test vectors is given in the ASN.1 schema.

## Full Vectors

Currently, the same test cases as tiny vectors but at a larger scale.
